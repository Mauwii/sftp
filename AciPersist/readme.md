# Persistent Configuration for Azure Container Instance

Mount this Folder to your 'Azure Container Instance' as /mnt/acipersist. In this way you can enjoy persistent Hostkeys which makes your (or your customers) file transfers more secure.

If you are prototyping (or just lazy) you could mount the Folder directly out of this git Repository.
